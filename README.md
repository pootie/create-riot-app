# create-riot-app
[RiotJS](https://github.com/riot/riot) startkit, based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and  [react-scripts](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/react-scripts).

‚ò∫ Adapted from [create-riot-app-ejected](https://github.com/alexstep/create-riot-app-ejected) (much thanks!) and stripped down to one todo.tag.

Package included simple app example, webpack dev server with **riot hot reload** and less, sass, stylus support. ES6 features available too. Jest with riot support for testing. ES6 and eslint in riot tag.

Just read https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md but replace all "react" word to "riot" :)
